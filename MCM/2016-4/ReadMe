	The main problem is to judge the direction of carema's movement by taking photos.At first we received videos from the camera which was connected to the computer,and analyzed the videos which is in low-resolution.We transfered the problem to detecting the moving object and tracking it.We put forward three different solutions to the problems.We use the openCV library to process the photos.Finally put these models into practice,and increase proformance of them and promote them.
	For this problem we built the object of reference model,Gaussian Mixture model,Optical Flow model.And we analyzed the advantage and disadvantage of these models,time complexity to determine the best solution.
	Finally we dicided to choose Optical Flow model which is more suitable for this problem.By this means we got the projection of moving objects from a series of phots we had taken then utilized grey-scale map and antivibration to consummate the model we had built.
